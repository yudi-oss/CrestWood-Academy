          The idea of establishing a model school that would provide quality
          all-round education to meritorious students coming from every walk of
          life in an environment that fosters unity in diversity was conceived
          in 1964. The idea was initiated by the Late King Mahendra in
          consultation with the then British Council representative, Lynndon
          Clough.
        </p>

        <p>
          After much planning and forethought, Crestwood Academy came into
          existence in 1972. As a joint venture between the Government of the
          United Kingdom and the Government of Nepal, the Nepali government
          provided the required land and the British government provided all
          the technical and financial assistance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Teaching started in 1973 with one building, 82 students (all boys)
          and about a dozen teachers. The same building served as the hostel,
          the cafeteria and the classrooms. The construction of other buildings
          (hostels, classrooms, dinning hall, assembly hall, sports hall and
          staff quarters) was completed by the end of 1978. Peter J. Wakeman
          became the first Headmaster of Crestwood Academy and Mr. Ratna
          Bahadur Tamot and Mr. Gehendra Man Udas were the first Nepali
          personnel to be appointed as teachers.

        <p>
          The first batch of students took the School Leaving Certificate
          Examination (the national exam that is taken at the end of class 10)
          in 1980. When 11 out of 14 students listed as the Top 10 position
          holders in the whole nation were from this school, Crestwood
          Academy established itself as the icon of quality education. In 1983,
          English was made the official language of instruction at Crestwood
          Academy and two years later the Cambridge University&#39;s Ordinary-Level
          program was introduced. The introduction of Advanced Level of the same
          took place in 1986.
        </p>

        <p>
          The major change came in 1991 when it was switched from &lsquo;Boys
          only school&rsquo; to a co-educational institution. The first batch
          of girls (14 in number) was introduced into the system the same year.
          The addition of two hostels, one of which was inaugurated by the late
          Princess Diana, in 1992 facilitated the increase in the girls&apos;
          population.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1994, the British Management handed over the administration to
          Nepalese management. In the years that followed the country saw many
          political and economic turmoil that no doubt posed many new challenges
          to Crestwood. But with the support of the government, the School
          Management Committee (SMC), teaching and administrative staff,
          students, parents and many other well-wishers, the school has been
          able to remain a true center of excellence.
        </p>

        <p>
          The growth of the school has never stopped. In 1997, the 10+2 program
          of the Higher Secondary Education Board of Nepal was introduced. New
          subjects were introduced in the A-level too. The student population
          continued to rise till it reached near about a thousand in 1999.
          Addition of new hostels for the girls in 1999 raised the girls&apos;
          population to over 300. The Learning Resource Centre, completed and
          inaugurated in 2008, has added another feather to its cap.
