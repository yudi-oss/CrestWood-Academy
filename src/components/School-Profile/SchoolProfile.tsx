        <p>
          Nepal, the land of the legendary Yeti, the birth place of Lord
          Buddha and home to the highest mountain of the world &ndash; Mt.
          Everest, is one of the developing countries in the world.
          Situated in Crestwood Municipality, in the Kathmandu Valley,
          Crestwood Academy (CEEB Code: 689070), is the government
          designated National School of Nepal. It is a fully residential
          English medium school established in December 1972 with the
          joint cooperation of the Government of Nepal and the Government
          of the United Kingdom (UK).
        </p>

        <p>
          In the first two decades of its operation, the school was headed
          by a succession of British Headmasters who did an excellent job
          of establishing and shaping the school into a &ldquo;Center of
          Excellence&rdquo;. The school was handed over to the Nepalese
          management in 1994, and since then it has continued to maintain
          the same high standards on all fronts. At present, the number of
          faculty is 81 and the support staff is 165, with a student
          faculty ratio of almost 14:1.
        </p>

        <p>
          The School is managed under the Public Trust, the main Trustee
          being the Ministry of Education. The Board of Trustees (BOT) and
          the School Management Committee (SMC) are chaired by the
          Secretary and the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Education
          and Sports respectively. Society of Ex Crestwood Students
          (SEBS), the alumni association, and Friends of Crestwood
          Academy (FOBS) are the two organizations that keenly take
          interest in the welfare of the school.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently there are 1123 students, of which 42% are girls.
          Students are selected from a wide range of socio-economic,
          cultural and ethnic backgrounds by the Ministry of Education and
          Sports, Nepal. Scholarships are provided to the meritorious and
          the needy ones from the weak social, economic and geographical
          backgrounds, and from all the seventy-seven districts of Nepal.

        <p>
          It is a two-year course in which students study English,
          Nepali, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry as compulsory
          subjects, and Biology or Computer Science as elective subjects

        <p>
          This is also a two-year course. English Language (AS Level) and
          Mathematics are compulsory for all students. In addition, each
          student takes one of the following subject combinations:

        <p>
          Apart from these officially offered combinations of subjects,
          students are free to appear privately in any one or more extra
          subjects on their own initiative. Some students may choose to do
          English General Paper (EGP) instead of English Language. To
          pass the Cambridge International A-Levels, students need to
          pass at least 3 A-Level subjects and AS Level English Language
          or English General Paper (EGP).
        </p>

          and Annual. In the second year, they sit for a semester
          examination (September), a Mid-year examination (January) and a
          Trial Examination (March). They then take up their final
